> June 1 2024: ***Sadly the launch was scrubbed again at T-3:50***

The Boeing Crew Flight Test (Boe-CFT) is the first crewed mission of the Boeing Starliner, following two uncrewed tests in 2019 and 2022. Scheduled for May 7, 2024, it was scrubbed due to an oxygen valve issue and later delayed due to a helium leak. Now rescheduled for June 1, 2024, the mission will last about eight days, with astronauts Barry E. Wilmore and Sunita Williams traveling to the International Space Station. The spacecraft, Starliner Calypso, will launch on an Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral SLC-41
