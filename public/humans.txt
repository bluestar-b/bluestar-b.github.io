/* COSMIC PERSPECTIVE */

"Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious.  
If a human disagrees with you, let him live.  
In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another."

— Carl Sagan

/* AND HERE YOU ARE... */

A fragile speck of dust,  
caught in the endless dance of the stars.  
A blink in the eye of the universe.  
Yet, you think you matter.  

On this tiny blue dot,  
you argue, you fight,  
you chase shadows and dreams,  
while the universe keeps expanding,  
silent, indifferent,  
uncaring of your victories or your failures.

You may live for a hundred years,  
but to the stars?  
A heartbeat.  

And when the light of the sun finally fades,  
your name will be forgotten like all the others.  
Just a ripple,  
disappearing in the vast sea of eternity.  

So here’s the question:  
What do you do,  
with your one precious, fragile moment,  
on this tiny, blue dot?
